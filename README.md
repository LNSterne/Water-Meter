# Water-Meter
Water meter for home use as an IoT device

A water meter that was attached to a velocity flow meter and powered by AC power. The device controls a normally open solenoid valve which closed when a leak was detected.
The water meter was designed to be installed on the main water pipe leading to the property.

The device is no longer is in use as I am no longer living at the property. There are different iterations of the water meter, the latest works with a SQL server which then displays information on a self hosted website

The second rely postion was occupied by a light that worked with Apple's Homekit via Home Bridge.

(Note: I do understand that the WiFi credentials are exposed, however the router is no longer in use.)
